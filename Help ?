I upgraded from pi-hole 4.8 (?I think) to 5.0.
After upgrading I get this error when trying to add to the (now empty) whitelist:
" Error, something went wrong! Session expired! Please re-login on the Pi-hole dashboard."

I also tried using the Group Management feature and get this error:
"DataTables warning: table id=groupsTable - Invalid JSON response. For more information about this error, please see http://datatables.net/tn/1"
I get the above errors after logging out/in etc multiple times -no difference.

I have already done a apt upgrade and apt update.
I use the pi for pi-hole and a cups printer hub. with drivers files for the printers I use.
I also installed byobu.
I have not installed anything else.

I was wondering if anyone else is having similar issues using :
Pi-hole Version v5.0 Web Interface Version v5.0 FTL Version v5.0

Any assistance appreciated.. either here or djcconsulting@gmail.com
